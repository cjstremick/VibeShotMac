# VibeShotMac 📸

A sleek macOS screenshot application with built-in markup capabilities, created entirely through **vibe coding** with AI assistance.

## ✨ What is VibeShotMac?

VibeShotMac is a native macOS app that enhances your screenshot workflow by providing:
- **Quick screenshot capture** with customizable overlays
- **Built-in markup editor** for annotations and edits
- **Seamless integration** with macOS screenshot workflows
- **Clean, intuitive interface** designed for efficiency

## 🤖 Created with Vibe Coding

This entire project was built using "vibe coding" - a development approach where ideas are translated into working code through natural language conversations with AI. No traditional coding tutorials, Stack Overflow searches, or documentation diving required!

### Example Initial Prompt

The project likely started with a prompt similar to this:

> *"I want to create a macOS screenshot app that can capture screens and let me quickly add annotations and markup. It should feel native to macOS and integrate well with the system. I want it to be fast and easy to use - something I'd actually want to use daily instead of the built-in screenshot tools. Can you help me build this?"*

From there, the AI helped:
- Set up the Xcode project structure
- Implement ScreenCaptureKit integration
- Create the markup editor interface
- Handle file management and user preferences
- Polish the UI/UX details

### The Vibe Coding Process

1. **Express the vision** - Describe what you want to build
2. **Iterate naturally** - Refine features through conversation
3. **Learn as you go** - Understand the code as it's created
4. **Ship quickly** - Go from idea to working app rapidly

## 🎉 About Vibe Coding

VibeShotMac demonstrates the power of vibe coding - building software by describing what you want rather than how to build it. This approach:

- **Lowers barriers** to software creation
- **Accelerates development** from idea to working product
- **Focuses on problems** rather than implementation details
- **Makes coding accessible** to more people
